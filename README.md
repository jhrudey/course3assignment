====================================================
The downloaded data were combined and cleaned to create a tidy dataset consisting of the means of the measurements per participant per activity, for the variables that referred to mean or standard deviations in the original raw data

This repository consists of:
====================================================
-'README.md'
-'CodeBook.md': a description of the variables in the final, tidy dataset, df_final, and the manipulations required to create this tidy dataset
-'run_analysis.R': the R script used to manipulate the raw data and create the tidy dataset, df_final
-'df_final.txt': a tab-deliminated text file; the tidy dataset representing the means of the measurements per participant per activity from the variables that referred to mean or standard deviations in the original raw data
-'run_analysis.R'
